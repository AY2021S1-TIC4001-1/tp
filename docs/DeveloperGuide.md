# Developer Guide

## Design & implementation

Project Tracker is a desktop app for managing and tracking projects,  optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). It will help the project manager to track the status of each project such as how many projects have been done per year or within a period.
You can refer to UML diagram image.![image of UML Class Diagram](UML Class diagram.PNG).


## Product scope
### Target user profile

The target user is a project manager who can keep tracking various projects, know the progress of each project with  principal members to participate in each project. However, he cannot remember the progress of various projects and who is the member that involve to each specific project.

### Value proposition

Project Tracker will help to solve to tracking and managing projects. It will involve person-in-charge, members who involved in each project and the description of each project. Furthermore, the duration of the project will be included in this Project Tracker that helps the project manager to know the timeframe of each project.
